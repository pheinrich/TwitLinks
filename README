TwitLinks
Copyright Â© 2015  Peter Heinrich

Simple command-line tool to process tweet data files and expand any shortened
links found in the tweet bodies. (The data files are generated by Twitter
analytics.) This allows tweets to be sorted by the sites they reference, and
makes it possible to track links that are over- or under-exposed.

Multiple input files (.csv) may be processed at once. Output will go to
separate files (.xlsx, same basename) or can be combined into one. If an
output file exists, it will be appended unless we explicitly request it to be
truncated first.
