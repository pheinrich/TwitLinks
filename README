TwitLinks
Copyright Â© 2015  Peter Heinrich

Simple command-line tool to process tweet data files and expand any shortened
links found in the tweet bodies. (The data files are generated by Twitter
analytics.) This allows tweets to be sorted by the sites they reference, and
makes it possible to track links that are over- or under-exposed.

Only the first link in a tweet is processed. Links that point back to Twitter
represent embedded media and aren't considered true target resources.
